# Chat-App-using-Socketio
Socket.io is a library that allows real-time, event-based communication in Node.js and browser-based applications. It uses the implementation of WebSockets protocol and offers some advantages over the protocol itself.
WebSockets allows us to communicate between a client and a server in a nonstandard way. The traditional way that a client and a server communicate is by following the request-response cycle. With WebSockets, however, there is an open connection established between the server and the client. This open connection makes it possible for both of them to communicate instantly.
so in this project I have used Socket.io to complete the chat appication.
